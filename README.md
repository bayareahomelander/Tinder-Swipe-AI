# Tinder-Swipe-AI

This project aims to build and train an AI to learn one's interest and have the AI do the swiping, using Google's TensorFlow and Python.

General overview as follows:
  - Go through and analyze Tinder API, understand how it works and what pieces of information are available (Done);
  - Create Python Classes that communicate with Tinder API to perform actions such as Like, Dislike (Done);
  - Download photos of people nearby, save them to a local folder for analysis and training (Done);
  - Write mouse-event classifier using TKinter for picture labeling (Done);
  - Build a pre-processor using TensorFlow Object Detection API for human recognition (In Progress);
  - Use neural network to learn classified/labeled data;
  - Deploy the model with Tinder API to swipe for the user.


This project is for personal and learning purpose only. No privacy was violated, data is publically accessible on Tinder's backend server.
